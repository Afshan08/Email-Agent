# EmailAgent Web Application

## Introduction

EmailAgent is a sophisticated web application designed to streamline email management by integrating deeply with Gmail. Built using Django on the backend and JavaScript on the frontend, this application offers users a seamless experience to sync, view, send, reply, and categorize emails. Leveraging asynchronous processing and AI-powered agents, EmailAgent intelligently categorizes incoming emails and can generate suggested replies, enhancing productivity and email handling efficiency. The application features a clean, professional interface with multiple views for inbox management, individual email review, and agent-generated responses.

These videos walk through the key features of EmailAgent, including Gmail sync, secure login, AI-generated replies, and asynchronous background processing.


## Distinctiveness and Complexity

EmailAgent stands apart from typical course projects by focusing on advanced email management rather than social networking or e-commerce functionalities. Unlike prior projects, it integrates directly with the Gmail API to synchronize emails in real-time, maintaining a local database of contacts and messages with detailed metadata. The complexity of this project is evident in several key areas:

- **Gmail API Integration:** The application handles both initial and incremental synchronization of Gmail messages, managing message states, threading, and metadata with precision.
- **AI Agent Integration:** EmailAgent incorporates asynchronous AI agents that analyze email content to categorize messages and generate context-aware reply suggestions, a feature not commonly found in standard projects.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** The use of Django async views and background processing ensures responsive user interactions even during complex email processing tasks.
- **Comprehensive Email Management:** The system supports sending, replying, deleting, and reviewing emails, with detailed tracking of read, replied, and agent-reviewed statuses.
- **Security and User Management:** Leveraging Djangoâ€™s authentication system, the app ensures secure access and user-specific data handling.

This combination of real-world API integration, AI-driven automation, and asynchronous design makes EmailAgent a uniquely challenging and feature-rich project that exceeds the complexity and distinctiveness requirements of the course.

## File Descriptions

- **emailagent/agentsworkflow/models.py:** Defines Django models for Gmail contacts, incoming emails with extensive metadata, and synchronization state tracking.
- **emailagent/emailagent/views.py:** Contains Django views handling email synchronization, inbox display, individual email retrieval, sending and replying to emails, and AI agent interaction.
- **emailagent/static/javascript/send_mails.js:** Frontend JavaScript managing user interactions for sending replies asynchronously via API calls.
- **emailagent/static/css/**: Contains CSS files defining the application's visual layout and styling. While explicit media queries are limited, the layout uses flexible box models for adaptable UI.
- **emailagent/emailagent/templates/**: HTML templates rendering the user interface for inbox, email details, agent responses, and other pages.
- **emailagent/agentsworkflow/utils.py:** Utility functions supporting email parsing, batching, and AI agent communication.
- **emailagent/authentication/**: Django app managing user authentication, signals, and related utilities.
- **emailagent/manage.py:** Django project management script.


## How to Run

1. **Set up a Python virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/Scripts/activate   # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate       # On Unix or MacOS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Apply database migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.

7. **Additional setup:**

   - Configure Gmail API credentials and OAuth for user authentication and email access.
   - Ensure environment variables or settings for Gmail API keys are properly set.

## Additional Information

- The project uses Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system to manage users securely.
- AI agents are integrated asynchronously to analyze and respond to emails, improving user productivity.
- The frontend uses JavaScript to provide interactive features such as sending replies without page reloads.
- While the CSS uses flexible layouts, further enhancements for mobile responsiveness can be added.
- The project requires Python packages.
- The application is designed to be extensible, allowing future improvements such as enhanced UI responsiveness, additional AI capabilities, and expanded email management features.
