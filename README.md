# 📬 EmailAgent

**EmailAgent** is a secure, AI-powered web application that helps users manage and reply to their emails intelligently. It integrates with Gmail using OAuth2 and lets users interact with their inbox through a smart, chat-based interface powered by OpenAI's Agent SDK.

The core goal is to **classify emails**, **identify important messages**, and **generate meaningful, personalized replies** that match the user’s writing style — all while keeping **user privacy and security** at the center.
