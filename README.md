# EmailAgent Web Application

## Introduction

EmailAgent is a sophisticated web application designed to streamline email management by integrating deeply with Gmail. Built using Django on the backend and JavaScript on the frontend, this application offers users a seamless experience to sync, view, send, reply, and categorize emails. Leveraging asynchronous processing and AI-powered agents, EmailAgent intelligently categorizes incoming emails and can generate suggested replies, enhancing productivity and email handling efficiency. The application features a clean, professional interface with multiple views for inbox management, individual email review, and agent-generated responses.

These videos walk through the key features of EmailAgent, including Gmail sync, secure login, AI-generated replies, and asynchronous background processing.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

EmailAgent stands apart from typical course projects by focusing on advanced email management rather than social networking or e-commerce functionalities. Unlike prior projects, it integrates directly with the Gmail API to synchronize emails in real-time, maintaining a local database of contacts and messages with detailed metadata. The complexity of this project is evident in several key areas:

- **Gmail API Integration:** The application handles both initial and incremental synchronization of Gmail messages, managing message states, threading, and metadata with precision. WIth that the challenging part was storing and refreshing access tokens as it did expired every hour and you had to request a new one. In this Api integration I learned to use function efficently and how to always call the function of getting access token that will check weather it is expired if it is not than return the token from the database and if it is than call another function that requests a access token by using a refresh token.

- **AI Agent Integration:** EmailAgent incorporates asynchronous AI agents that analyze email content to categorize messages and generate context-aware reply suggestions, a feature not commonly found in standard projects.

- **Asynchronous Processing:** The use of Django async views and background processing ensures responsive user interactions even during complex email processing tasks.

- **Comprehensive Email Management:** The system supports sending, replying, deleting, and reviewing emails, with detailed tracking of read, replied, and agent-reviewed statuses.

- **Security and User Management:** Leveraging Djangoâ€™s authentication system, the app ensures secure access and user-specific data handling. Also a great resourse like django allauth was used in this project to setup Google Auth system and I also poupulated my own database by using restful api in the singnals.py file. It was difficult for me and I did not did it all by myself I asked Ai for help by explaining that I want the data from google to be collected my way that was the reason of creating the authentication app and there I stored data from google using my api.
Next thing that I faced problem in was designing  the allauth or social app pages of login and others. I asked AI so much and the results were still not there and no change. But finally the next day I thought to read the documentaion of all auth library and with like 10 minutes I figured out how to style it. Even my page is not styled that much but still I like it that way as well.

This combination of real-world API integration, AI-driven automation, and asynchronous design makes EmailAgent a uniquely challenging and feature-rich project that exceeds the complexity and distinctiveness requirements of the course.

## File Descriptions

- **emailagent/agentsworkflow/models.py:** Defines Django models for Gmail contacts, incoming emails with extensive metadata, and synchronization state tracking. These models were not that easy to plan specially the IncomingEmails one. at the start I made two models called Incoming and Outgoing mails but than I noticed that the mails can be incoming and outgoing at the same time and the context that is the user that matters. Like if I send a mail to my sister for me it is outgoing but for her it is incoming. So thats why I changed the models to have only IncomingEmail and have the attribute is_outgoing. Than there is a model called GmailSynState that was essential and trouble some to make as well. When I made the mdoel I though that this is  such a problem now I will also have to query this database before sending request to Gmail Server but when I used it in my application than the way everything was working effeciently made me think that every thing was worth it.
And than there was this model called GmailContact that I made for obvious reasons.

- **emailagent/emailagent/views.py:** Contains Django views handling email synchronization, inbox display, individual email retrieval, sending and replying to emails, and AI agent interaction. The biggest problem that I faced was not able to do database queries because it was prohibited in aysnc environement and therefore I searched for a solution and found about the syn_to_async and async_to_sync decorators.

- **emailagent/static/javascript/send_mails.js:** Frontend JavaScript managing user interactions for sending replies asynchronously via API calls. this javascript file calls the api I made in the views.py file and when the api is called the record of reply from database is than sent via gmail.

- **emailagent/static/css/**: Contains CSS files defining the application's visual layout and styling. the layout uses flexible box models for adaptable UI.

- **emailagent/emailagent/templates/**: HTML templates rendering the user interface for inbox, email details, agent responses, and other pages.

- **emailagent/agentsworkflow/utils.py:** Utility functions supporting email parsing, batching, and AI agent communication. This is the file that plays a major role becasue this file has the orignal agents inside it the functions I use to parse the data from database into a predictable object. the functions or tools for agent like getting the context or getting the current time.
- **emailagent/authentication/**: Django app managing user authentication, signals, and related utilities.
- **emailagent/manage.py:** Django project management script.


## How to Run

1. **Set up a Python virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/Scripts/activate   # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate       # On Unix or MacOS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Apply database migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.

7. **Additional setup:**

   - Configure Gmail API credentials and OAuth for user authentication and email access.
   - Ensure environment variables or settings for Gmail API keys are properly set.

## Additional Information
